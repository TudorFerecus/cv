        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="bio">I'm currently a student at "Mihai Vietazul" National College. Coding makes me feel in control of what I'm doing and helps me express myself, which is why I'm working on improving my skills as a programmer. Apart from coding, I am playing basketball at a semi-professional level  and work out..</p>

          <h3 class="skillsubtitle">Game Development</h3>
          <p>In the past year of learning game development, I've made over 10 games as independent projects and one for a company. My target is to work on more paid projects for companies that want to advertise themselves through games in order to make enough money to start working on my own projects.</p>

          <p>One of the skills I'm working to aquire is web development, this site being made entirely from what I know in this area and continueously improving it as i aquire more knowledge. Even though I am just scratching the surface right now, I fell excited for the projects that will come, made for me or for other people.</p>

          <h3 class="skillsubtitle">Basketball</h3>
          <p>For the past 5 years basketball represented a very big part of my life. It thought me discipline and motivation, how to work in a team and how to help it. It made me a hard-working person and now some of the skills I've learnt there, I apply in other fields.</p>
